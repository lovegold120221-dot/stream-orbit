"""One bidirectional Gemini Live session bridging a speaker to a target language.

We talk to Gemini Live via a raw WebSocket against the v1beta BidiGenerateContent
endpoint rather than via google-genai's `client.aio.live.connect()`. The v1beta
API expects `translationConfig` nested under `generationConfig` (renamed from the
EAP-era `streamingTranslationConfig` at the public launch). Bypassing the SDK lets
us control the exact JSON shape; python-genai >= 2.8.0 now exposes a matching
`TranslationConfig` if we later choose to adopt the SDK.

            "voice from the AVAILABLE VOICE POOL below.\n"
            "2. Assign voices in order of speaker appearance: first detected "
            "speaker gets the first voice in the pool, second gets the second, "

            "4. The voice assignment governs BOTH the vocal delivery in the "
            "translated audio AND the speaker tag in the source transcription. "

            "from one another. The listener must be able to identify which "
            "speaker is talking from the audio alone, even without speaker "
            "tags.\n"

            "modulate pitch, speed, and emotion for dramatic effect \u2014 "

            "pitch range) must remain consistent for that speaker.\n"

                "and vice versa. Bilabial sounds (p, b, m) should roughly align "

                "  \u2022 When a perfect phonetic match is impossible, prioritise "
